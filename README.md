# ARMA_Touchscreen

main.cpp in the src folder contains the code I am currently working on. 
The code does not contain header files due to an include error. Hence all the definitions exist in the same file.
I will fix this once the screen starts to work. 


The folder "EVE-Basic-Demo-STM32-master" contains the repository uploaded by the manufacturer which I am using as a reference.
